method."),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"Applications could also exist for other uses besides normal social networking.\nAs previously mentioned, an app like AirBnb could be created on Subsocial,\nwhich would

the other app. They could then offer the future option to transfer\nall of a user's content and NFTs to a new wallet that a user created, allowing the user to transition to a decentralized
